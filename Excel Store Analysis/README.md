- **Customer Analytics:** Analyze customer data to gain insights into demographics, purchase behaviors, and customer lifetime value. Identify high-value customers, target segments for marketing campaigns, and personalize customer experiences.

- **Trend Analysis:** Identify sales trends over time and seasonal patterns, and forecast future sales. Use regression analysis or time series forecasting techniques to predict future demand.

- **Geographical Analysis:** Map store locations, analyze sales performance by region, and identify areas of opportunity or underperformance. Use heat maps or geospatial analysis to visualize geographic trends.

- **Data Filtering and Slicing:** Provide interactive filters and slicers to allow users to drill down into specific data subsets or filter by various criteria. This enables users to explore the data from different perspectives and gain deeper insights.

- **Data Refresh and Automation:** Set up automatic data refresh to ensure that the dashboard is always up to date with the latest stored data. Automate data retrieval and transformation processes to save time and effort.
